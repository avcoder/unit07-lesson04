# Recap

- career lab tmrw + tech lab tmrw at the same time
  - attend career lab first, then once finished come to the tech lab
  - I will record PHP's Input Validation, Edit/Delete functionality during the time you're at career lab, (or save that material for another class)
  - Once career lab is finished and you're back to tech lab we can either do AMA, and/or go over the [Getting Started page with Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- For this class, get your credit card ready (if you wish), Buy a cheap domain name (I use namecheap.com) so we can practice connecting our Render apps to a legit domain
  - we'll go over the steps on how to buy a domain name
  - reminder: Github Education Pack gives a free `.me` domain for 1 year
- will mark Weather App assignments over weekend

# Enter Name Servers

- `my-awesome-app.info`, won't work yet; need a way point to which servers have the answer
- Can get name servers from where we hosted our frontend (ex: Netlify, Render etc.)

# Domain Name System (DNS)

- A name server is a part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which is like the internet's phone book
- Its job is to translate human-readable domain names (like yourdomain.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1)

# IP Addresses

- An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network (like the internet). It works like a home address, allowing devices to send and receive data.
- There are two main versions:
  - IPv4, ex: 192.168.1.1, Size: 32 bits, Allows 4.3 billion unique addresses
  - IPv6, ex: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, Size: 128 bits, Allows 3.4√ó10¬≥‚Å∏ addresses

# How IP Addresses Work (Routing Basics)
- When you send a request (e.g., visit a website), your device uses its IP address to communicate.
- DNS translates domain names (like example.com) into an IP address.
- Routers use IP addresses to forward packets through the internet to the correct destination.
- The receiving device sees your IP address and sends a response back.

# DNS server types

- Recursive resolver
  - (aka DNS recursor) is the first stop in a DNS query
  - responds with either cached data, or send a request to a root, TLD, authoritative nameserver
- Root nameserver
  - receive query for domain name, and responds by directing to TLD nameserver
- TLD nameserver
  - maintains info for all ".com" domain names for example, responds with authoritative nameserver
- Authoritative nameserver
  - the last step in the journey for an IP address lookup
  - contains info specific to the domain name and responds with IP address

# What is a CDN?

- CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably and securely as possible
- to be performant, CDN will place servers at strategic locations (at highly interconnected locations)

# Deploy Node/Express/Vite app on Render

- Other options to deploy: AWS, Fly.io, Railway, Azure
- Change DB connection string to be an environment variable
- Deploy step-by-step, test that frontend communicates with backend api

# Lab: Serverless

- read https://www.netlify.com/blog/intro-to-serverless-functions/
- let's try to deploy a serverless function
- create a voting app that calls an API (i.e. serverless function) and draws a dynamic chart based on live votes

# Lab  
PHP continued: Server-side validation on blank fields

- Problem: On the input form try entering a bunch of space characters for the game title
- Problem: user can inspect DOM and remove `required` attributes or add `novalidate` to form tag to bypass client-side validation
- After extrapolating POST variables and before our `$sql` statement:
```php
// Validation #1: Prevent blank fields.  Use https://phpsandbox.io/ to test
$is_form_valid = true;

if (empty(trim($title)))) {
  echo "Please enter a title";
  exit; // temporarily can exit just to test if above works.  remove it after.
  $is_form_valid = false;
}

if ($is_form_valid) {
  // go ahead with all the SQL code all the way until echo "Game Saved?"
}
```

# PHP: Server-side Validation on year field

- Problem: try entering alphabetic characters in the year field
- Problem: try entering -000123 in the year field
- Solution: 
  - use [sanitize filters](https://phpdoctest.github.io/en/filter.filters.sanitize.html)
  - use [validate filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.constants.php#constant.filter-validate-bool)

```php
// replace our $year = $_POST['year'] with:
$year = filter_var($_POST['year'], FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT); 
// can test above with values: "2021", "asdf", "-00123"

$year_regex = "/[0-9]{4}";

if ($year < 0 || strlen($year) != 4 || !preg_match($year_, $year)) {
  echo "PLease enter a valid year";
  $is_form_valid = false;
}
```

# PHP: Sanitize Input against XSS injection

- Problem: try entering `<h1>Frogger</h1>`
- Problem: try entering `<script>alert("hacked")</script>`

```php
// replace our $_POST statements with all our string inputs
$title = filter_var(trim($_POST['title']), FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
$genre = filter_var(trim($_POST['genre']), FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
$url = filter_var(trim($_POST['url']), FILTER_VALIDATE_URL);
```
